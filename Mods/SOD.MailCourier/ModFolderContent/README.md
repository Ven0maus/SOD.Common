# SOD.MailCourier

Adds a new way to earn money by allowing players to take on mail delivery jobs from any newsstand.  
Accepting a job requires a 50-crow deposit, which is fully refunded upon successful delivery.  
This deposit discourages abandoning the job and ensures commitment to completing the delivery.

### Features
- Adds a unique mail courier job item to every news stand.
- Adds a new unique sync disk that compliments the new mail courier job.

### How does it work?
1. Collect a mail job from any news stand
2. Open the player inventory and hover over or select the mail item to see the delivery address.
3. Go to the mentioned address, find the corresponding mailbox for the specified address.
4. Take the mail item in your hand (select from inventory) and place it in the mailbox.
4. You will receive an automated payment immediately on delivery.

### Reward
On delivery you will be paid immediately:  
(50 crow refund) + 75 crows + an extra 75% of the distance from the news stand to the delivery address.

(This reward can be fully configured in the config options.)
