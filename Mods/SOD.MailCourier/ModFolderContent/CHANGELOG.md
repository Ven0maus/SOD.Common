# CHANGELOG
**1.0.2**
- Improved destination route pointing to the mailbox instead of the specific residence
- When unequipping a sealed mail the route will be unplotted (unless its not the route for the mail)
- When equipping a sealed mail the route to it will be plotted (if no route is currently plotted, unless its another mail)
(both these 2 can be enforced to always overwrite, through the config options)

**1.0.1**
- Effectively a reupload, because the previous upload was a wrong version

**1.0.0**
- Initial release
